# Welcome to the MarvelHeros Project!

In this project I use the Marvel API found in: https://developer.marvel.com/

Here you can find a live use case scenario with the hero data section of the API.

When using the app you can search for your favorite heros and get data about their apperances in: Comics, Series, and Events that
occured in all of the Marvel Universe.

The project is up and running in: https://roeikat.github.io/MarvelHeros/.

Have fun!
